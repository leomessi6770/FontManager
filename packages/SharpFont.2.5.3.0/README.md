### Cross-platform FreeType bindings for .NET

SharpFont is a library that provides FreeType bindings for .NET. It's MIT licensed to make sure licensing doesn't get
in the way of using the library in your own projects. Unlike
[Tao.FreeType](http://taoframework.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/taoframework/trunk/src/Tao.FreeType/), SharpFont provides
the full public API and not just the basic methods needed to render simple text. Everything from format-specific APIs
to the caching subsystem are included.

SharpFont simplifies the FreeType API in a few ways:

 - The error codes that most FreeType methods return are converted to exceptions.
 - Since the return values are no longer error codes, methods with a single `out` parameter are returned instead.
 - Most methods are instance methods instead of static methods. This avoids unnecessary redundancy in method calls and
creates an API with a .NET look-and-feel.

For example, a regular FreeType method looks like this:

```C
Face face;
int err = FT_New_Face(library, "./myfont.ttf", 0, &face);
```

The equivalent code in C# with SharpFont is:

```CSharp
Face face = new Face(library, "./myfont.ttf");
```

##Quick Start

###NuGet
SharpFont is available on [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/SharpFont/). It can be installed by issuing the following
command in the package manager console:

```
PM> Install-Package SharpFont
```

###From Source
Clone the repository and compile the solution. Copy `SharpFont.dll` to your project and include it as a reference. On
Windows, you must include a compiled copy of FreeType2 as `freetype6.dll` in the project's output directory. It is
possible to rename the file by changing the filename constant in
[FT.Internal.cs](SharpFont/blob/master/SharpFont/FT.Internal.cs) and recompile. On Linux and OSX (and any other
Mono-supported platform), you must also copy `SharpFont.dll.config` to the project's output directory.

####Mono
If compiling on the command line, `xbuild` will choose the Debug WIN64 configuration by default, which will cause
issues. Instead, run `make` to compile with the proper configuration.

####FreeType
A 32-bit copy of `freetype6.dll` is included in the [Examples](SharpFont/blob/master/Examples) project.

Currently, Windows 64-bit systems require you to either compile SharpFont under the WIN64 configurations and include a
64-bit copy of `freetype6.dll` or to compile your project as an x86 project (instead of Any CPU). I describe this issue
in further detail in the Known Issues section.

##Compiling FreeType on Windows

The included copy of `freetype6.dll` is something I build on my machine when a new version of FreeType is released.
This means that it may not work on older versions of Windows. If this is the case, you can compile FreeType yourself
from source.

**Note**: Any copy of `freetype6.dll` can work as a drop-in replacement, including
[this copy](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/freetype.htm) from the GnuWin32 project. Older versions such as
that one may crash with a `EntryPointException` when using newer APIs.

Thanks to [this StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7387618/1122135) for the directions:

 1. Download the latest [FreeType source code](http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/).
 2. Open `builds\win32\vc2010\freetype.sln` (or whatever version of Visual Studio you have) in Visual Studio.
 3. Change the compile configuration from Debug to Release.
 4. Open the project properties window through Project -> Properties.
 5. In the `General` selection, change the `Target Name` to `freetype6` and the `Configuration Type` to `Dynamic
Library (.dll)`.
 6. Open up `ftoption.h` (in the project's `Header Files` section) and add the following three lines near the `DLL
export compilation` section:

```C
#define FT_EXPORT(x) __declspec(dllexport) x
#define FT_EXPORT_DEF(x) __declspec(dllexport) x
#define FT_BASE(x) __declspec(dllexport) x
```

Finally, complile the project (`F6` or Build -> Build Solution). `freetype6.dll` will be output to `objs\win32\vc2010`.

##Known Issues

The biggest currently known issue is the Windows 64-bit incompatibility. This is a three part issue:

 - Windows uses the LLP64 data model while most other operating systems (including Linux and OSX) use the LP64 data
model. This means that on Windows, only `long long`s and pointers are 64 bits long and everything else remains 32 bits
long. On LP64 systems, `long`s are also 64 bits long. This creates a discrepancy between the length of the `long` type
on different operating systems.
 - FreeType makes heavy use of the `long` type, specifically their `FT_Long`, `FT_ULong`, `FT_Fixed`, `FT_Pos`, and
`FT_F26Dot6` typedefs. This makes the size of FreeType structs different on Windows 64-bit systems and other 64-bit
systems.
 - The C# `long` type is always 64 bits long, which doesn't always match the length of the native `long` type. For all
LP64 systems, the `IntPtr` type works because it's length matches the length of a pointer on that system. For LLP64
systems, this doesn't work because `long` is 32 bits long while a pointer is 64 bits long.

The simplest solution is to compile your project as x86 because all systems will default on the 32 bit FreeType binary.
However, this can be restrictive to some applications. The best solution is to compile a version of FreeType with
64-bit `long`s, which I will look into and test in the near future.
